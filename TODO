* make an end screen
*make sure the game repeats after finishing
* make it so the textboxs at the end screen
    are not writeable


* remember to limit the game to have at least two players
    before starting
* remember to set it so the storyteller has to
    approve everything before starting the game
* remember to set the time of sending info to
    1000 instead of 0

You're doing great! Just keep going :)
